In this lab, you learn how to launch a solution using Cloud Marketplace.

Deploying the LAMP stack on Compute Engine

Connect to your instance
gcloud compute ssh


Install Apache and PHP on your instance
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5

Install MySQL on your instance
sudo apt-get install mysql-server php-mysql php-pear

Configure MySQL
sudo mysql_secure_installation

Install phpMyAdmin
sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin

Transferring files
gcloud compute scp [LOCAL_FILE_PATH] lamp-tutorial:/var/www/html

Task 3: Verify your deployment
When the deployment is complete, click the Site address link in the right pane.


Close the congratulations browser tab.

Connect to your instance
gcloud compute ssh

In a new window, a secure login shell session on your virtual machine appears.

In the just-created SSH window, to change the current working directory to /opt/bitnami, execute the following command:

cd /opt/bitnami

To copy the phpinfo.php script, execute the following command:

sudo sh -c 'echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > apache2/htdocs/phpinfo.php'

The phpinfo.php script displays your PHP configuration. It is often used to verify a new PHP installation.

To close the SSH window, execute the following command:

exit

Open a new browser tab.

Type the following URL, and replace SITE_ADDRESS with the URL in the Site address field in the right pane of the lampstack page.

http://SITE_ADDRESS/phpinfo.php

A summary of the PHP configuration of your server is displayed.

Close the phpinfo tab.
