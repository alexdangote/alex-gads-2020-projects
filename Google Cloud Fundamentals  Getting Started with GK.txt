Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with GKE
Task 3: Start a Kubernetes Engine cluster
For convenience, place the zone that Qwiklabs assigned you to into an environment variable called MY_ZONE. At the Cloud Shell prompt, type this partial command:
export MY_ZONE=
2.Start a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubernetes Engine. Name the cluster webfrontend and configure it to run 2 nodes:
gcloud container clusters create webfrontend --zone $MY_ZONE --num-nodes 2

After the cluster is created, check your installed version of Kubernetes using the kubectl version command:
kubectl version
The gcloud container clusters create command automatically authenticated kubectl for you.

Task 4: Run and deploy a container
From your Cloud Shell prompt, launch a single instance of the nginx container. (Nginx is a popular web server.)
kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx:1.17.10

View the pod running the nginx container:
kubectl get pods
Expose the nginx container to the Internet:
kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type LoadBalancer

View the new service:
kubectl get services

Scale up the number of pods running on your service:
kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 3

Confirm that Kubernetes has updated the number of pods:
kubectl get pods
Confirm that your external IP address has not changed:
kubectl get services
